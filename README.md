1. From the package manager console, run ```MP> Update-Database``` to update the database.
2. Using the swagger api to add the parking fees, 
  remember that the vehicle types are: 
    0 for official vehicles, 
    1 for resident vehicles, and 
    2 for non-resident vehicles.
3. To add vehicles use the methods of the road API/Parking interface. From there you can solve the required use cases.

The connection to the database is in appsettings.json and the database name is "ParkingServiceDB"
